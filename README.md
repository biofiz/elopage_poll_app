#TEST TASK RUBY  

Our task is to create a simple voting rails app. The main features should be user registration and login, poll creation and link generation for the poll, which other users/friends can use to access and vote. The poll has a title and as many options as the user makes.

Pages:
Login (index), Registration (first and last name, email, password), Poll CRUD, Poll voting/show for voters.

For the task please use:

* Rails
* Postgresql your choice
* Bootstrap for UI
* Use HAML
* Write some tests using rspec and some integration tests with capybara and cucumber. Full test coverage is not needed just write something to show knowledge.
* Create a repo in Github or bitbucket and push your progress there and share the link with us.

Bonus:

* Make the Poll show page realtime when voting

You can use whatever gems you like, except any gem that makes everything above and makes the task senseless.
